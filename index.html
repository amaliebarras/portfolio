	   <p><br><br>This was partially due to a series of impatient teachers in primary school, and partially due to a widely held belief that a creative person could not also be a numbers person. In 2009, I applied to advertising school with big plans to become a designer, and I was super excited, but not about the required digital measurement classes. Out of necessity, I cracked open this book called Web Analytics 2.0<br>
		  AND IT ROCKED MY WORLD<br>
		  Because finally someone was talking to me ...about numbers<br>
  		  Like a REAL PERSON<br>
	  	  And I understood it<br>
		  And I wanted more<br><br>
		  *cue identity crisis*<br><br>
		  When I shared with my prof how life-changing it was to be related-to instead of talked-at, he introduced me to the world of data visualization. I became fascinated with the work of Kim Rees, Hans Rosling, Nathan Yau, Nick Felton...You’re telling me I can work with data AND use my design chops to help us non-nerds understand it? <br><br>
		  I wanted to shout it from the mountaintops, but that’s not where decisions get made, so I took to starting my career as an analyst, knowing I had the secret weapons: <br><br>
		  storytelling and visualization<br><br>
		  Now that I’ve found my place in the sun, let me help you:<br><br>
		  Analyze your data<br>
		  Tell stories with it<br>
		  Design your data platform’s UX<br>
		  Develop your website<br>
		  Remember to breathe<br><br>
		  Let me help you make “numbers people” out of your people<br><br>
