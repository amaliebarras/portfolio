	  <p><font size = 1>This was partially due to a series of impatient teachers in primary school,<br>
		  <font size = 2>And partially due to a widely held belief that a creative person could not also be a numbers person<br><br>
		  <font size = 1> In 2009, I applied to advertising school with big plans to become a designer and I was super excited, 
		  but not about the required digital measurement classes</br>

		  <br>Out of necessity, I cracked open this book called Web Analytics 2.0<br>
		  <font size = 2>AND IT ROCKED MY WORLD<br>
		  <font size = 1>Because finally someone was talking to me ...about numbers<br>
  		  <font size = 2>Like a REAL PERSON<br>
	  	  And I understood it<br>
		  And I wanted more<br><br><font size = 1>

		  *cue identity crisis*<br><br>

		  When I shared with my prof how life-changing it was to be related-to instead of talked-at,
		  <br>he introduced me to the world of data visualization…

		  I became fascinated with the work of Kim Rees, Hans Rosling, Nathan Yau, Nick Felton...<br>

		  <font size = 2>You’re telling me I can work with data AND use my design chops to help us non-nerds understand it? <br><br>

		  <font size = 1>I wanted to shout it from the mountaintops<br>

		  But that’s not where decisions get made<br>
		  So I took to starting my career as an analyst, knowing I had the secret weapons: <br><br>
		  <font size = 3>storytelling and visualization<br><br>

		  <font size = 1>Now that I’ve found my place in the sun, let me help you:<br>

		  <font size = 3> <br>
		  Analyze your data<br>
		  Tell stories with it<br>
		  Design your data platform’s UX<br>
		  Develop your website<br>
		  Remember to breathe<br><br>

		  <font size = 1>Let me help you make “numbers people” out of your people<br><br>
